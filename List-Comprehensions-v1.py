#list comprehensions are powerful but poorly explained by the current top two ranking websites. That's because they are
#1, the company website, 2, some random blog with affiliate links and viruses, popup ads.... and I'm excited to show you
#a proper list comprehensions tutorial, without a single pop up, google ad, or affilate link. Python for beginners sold
#their blog off for marginal return, and we are going to destroy that blog, to the moon and beyond. (looks like a bunch
# of automated and poorly thought out content, with a bunch of spammy backlink SEO, that I can probably
# nuke from an SEO perspective.)

#Making Lists in Python - List Comprehensions
#By Tyler Garrett
#
#some may call this an "i for i" + "python" on google! lol
#Why is Tyler Garrett rebuilding the wiki on List comprehensions?
# The current content when googling i for i python or list comprehensions, is currently plundered with garbage water.
# the domain pythonforbeginners is a pile of trash water ranking with the water from a garbage bin in an alley people
# don't frequent. What's lame is they are considered authority with a BUNCH of affilate links, virus pop ups, and google ads.
# Because I am an overly emotional blogger who gives a shat about people getting quality content, I'm going to stop at
# nothing until I beat pythonforbeginners out of whatever keywords I decide to aim at, and I will not stop at one.
#
#How is Tyler Garrett going to change the way people learn building a list in python aka list comprehensions?
# I learned list comprehensions from scratch, no mentor, no internet, on a laptop in Louisiana, down by the river!!!
# During, I ran into a bunch of trash water blogs (with limited connectivity from my dads samsung galaxy phone)
# and so far, most if not all examples don't explain variations or granular details, and the past few years
# I basically blog about every type of technology I learn along the process, so list comprehensions is no different
# than some rabbit dive I've done, professionally, but here - it's all new and the help docs suck, big time!
# HOW? - Building better tutorials, with pound for pound better content, on a website built for helping new python developers.
# With data analysis, competitor analysis, web scraping, and tons of google data, I'm going to find exactly how to beat
# this trash water website.
#
#What will Tyler Garrett be generating with this list comprehensions wiki?
# First of all - the 1st Badass tutorial on List Comprehensions - with overly explained stuff...
# Explaining how different code examples work, based on different usages of the code, with real world help...
# A list comprehensions wiki that dominates pythonforbeginners insides and outsides, your trash water strinks.
# Non-trashwater solution to learning, without affilate links or poorly written blogs.
# what's cool is the competition is low, and the yield for me to learn python, and network with people who
# think quality content is king, well.. yeah, let's network fam. I spend most of my time helping others, giving back,
# and blogging about complex things, in simple manners.
