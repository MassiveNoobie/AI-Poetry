#Poem Gen-v10.6+, push to wordpress. Offering the ability to automate posting to wordpress, these little randomized poems...
#input expects a text file, keep it clean, not random symbols or odd content... book text and people will probably follow you...
#when i noticed i got more followers posting random dumb stuff, and not blogs i work on for an entire weekend... I realized one thing..
#maybe we all need to automate a bit of content.
#end goal here was to learn python, previous examples of code in this library will explain every detail of the code below.
#if you need help, ping me  @  tylergarrett.com
