<h1>Learning about automated poem generation using Python and a book text file</h1>

Question; Can i generate traffic with fake poems?
Answer; Yes.

Conclusion; if content is not unique, the backlinks do not last very long. Yes you can generate traffic, but it's a short lived "gain" and it's nearly always a fake robot parsing through because it's a related "tag" "h1" and P text that they latch on to because of the word usage. Dripping through wordpress has its own system of tags/robots, etc. this does generate SEO value but again, the content isn't good content and doesn't last long as far as BACKLINKS are concerned. (Later i transition to rss feed down similar pipeline found; https://github.com/MassiveNoobie/python-RSS-feeds, a much smarter/safer and internet friendly path)


Check out this little auto blogging tool, built to push content from a text file, makes some what sensible sentences, and pushes it to wordpress.

I'm attaching a bit of content regarding how to loop it, if you don't want to learn how to build that process in python. Understandable. Maybe just want to stress test your wordpress website? Okay, sure.

Fast forward and skip the muck unless you want to learn python, read the old-read-me.

Here's the steps to automate blogging...

Important note...
Use appropriate tags.
Attach appropriate categories and tags to your posts so people can find them in the WordPress.com Reader. But be careful not to use too many tags â€” less than 15 tags (or categories or both) is a good number. The more tags you use, the less likely your post will be featured in the Reader. Read more on tagging.

It's not much :)
