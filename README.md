# AI-Poetry
Understanding the SEO algorithm has become a large hobby of mine. Now, I want to figure out the SEO Glue. And that requires a lot of data. In order to get there, I need to learn python, and a lot of other things. Since I have no clue what I'm doing, I think starting here will make sense... The goal is to build an AI poetry, and who the heck thinks thats cool? So far, I see it's just me, learning how to make random stuff, in order to generate data, for the future.


# Hacked/Hijacked by Tyler Garrett ... sorry ahead of time
# Reason for hijacking - ultimatly interested in generating unique unstructured
# ... text, to generate a kind of digital "poerty," and the output will be data
# ... The data generated will tell us a lot about the neccesity of unique content
# ... when ranking and generating backlinks. Not to manipulate ranking, rather to
# ... understand SEO best practices, to apply to content written by a human.
# ... The test below is a simple form of randomizing from a file input. Any input.
# ... because I'm new at Python, I want to start here, using Mehrab's script, pycharm...
# ... and a little free time while my son is going down for sleep.
# ... I'm eager to understand the how and why below, and generate a mountain of SEO data.
# ... The true reasoning is to generate a unique use case, I want to eventually pump this
# ... content into Medium.com, where I will keep track of the incoming analytics.
# ... incoming analytics will tell us an independent use case, generated roboticly.
# ... The output will be SEO data to dive in, discover, and test again. The training
# ... for me will offer a place to write about automated poetry.
# ... My end goal is to generate a type of robot that can scrape over the entire poetry
# ... output and tell me the overall sentiment of the project explained above. The reason
# ... behind doing all of this work is to build a type of smart poetry bot.
# ... but without data, how smart can my bot be? I want to be able to generate a few things
# ... at the end of this project, a bot that says whether or not the poetry is good, (longterm)
# ... my long term vision would be to get the data together, per page, republish my findings.
# ... The data will serve to be a guide to not only digital marketing best practices
# ... but also a good usecase to explain the complexities of digital content, content
# ... to allow end users, like you and me, to vote whether or not the bot made GOOD or BAD
# ... poetry, and effectively I want to build a community where people can collab on poems.
# ... Beyond that I would like to plug musicblip into the smart poetry machine, and
# ... come up with ways to use the "good" sounding analog recordings, with "good" poems.
# ... not trying to automate music, just trying to lay down the ground work for it...
# ... if I can get people to actively say "yes" or "no" - we could generate a logisitic
# ... regression model around what is going to be considered good or bad, based on the
# ... overall structure, sentiment analysis, and other things of that nature.
# ... I want to automate "good sounding" poetry... not just any poetry.
# ... By the time the project is complete, I will need to learn more about data science
# ... I hear some algorithms can handle this complexitiy, but to build a model...
# ... I need to build the data. And what's cool is, this nice, tangible, beautiful little
# ... bit of SEO packaged into it, and the data that comes with it will tell us...
# ... if maybe, just maybe, sentiment analysis and sentiment scoring is a part of ranking.
# ... maybe...
# # # # Cheers
