# AI-Poetry
I want to make content that inspires people. 
https://github.com/MassiveNoobie/AI-Poetry/blob/master/Poem%20Gen-v10.2.py

Why:
 Poem generation - I want to build poems to help inspire others with "whatever it is they need in that moment."
 Data generation - I need to make data because I'm a data nerd.

Future ideas:
 AI poem generation - "can we make good poetry?"
 Understanding what "good" poetry is considered from a human perspective.
 Program the bot to follow the success data, (datascience) based on human and robot scores.
 Lastly, to apply sentiment score from several different sentiment scoring data sources.
 Release tutorials on python, rank it to the moon, as I learn through the code...

Tips:
 occassionally this app hits the bottom of the poem and errors out.
 run it again (it will work). future error handling could include re-run based on error output! rad. <3 this stuff.
 Most hilarious output I've caught thus far, <a href="http://tylergarrett.com">Tyler Garrett</a> smiled, for worms.
 lol


Understanding the SEO algorithm has become a large hobby of mine. Now, I want to figure out the SEO Glue. And that requires a lot of data. In order to get there, I need to learn python, and a lot of other things. Since I have no clue what I'm doing, I think starting here will make sense... The goal is to build an AI poetry, and who the heck thinks thats cool? So far, I see it's just me, learning how to make random stuff, in order to generate data, for the future.


 Hacked/Hijacked by Tyler Garrett ... sorry ahead of time
 Reason for hijacking - ultimatly interested in generating unique unstructured
 ... text, to generate a kind of digital "poerty," and the output will be data
 ... The data generated will tell us a lot about the neccesity of unique content
 ... when ranking and generating backlinks. Not to manipulate ranking, rather to
 ... understand SEO best practices, to apply to content written by a human.
 ... The test below is a simple form of randomizing from a file input. Any input.
 ... because I'm new at Python, I want to start here, using Mehrab's script, pycharm...
 ... and a little free time while my son is going down for sleep.
 ... I'm eager to understand the how and why below, and generate a mountain of SEO data.
 ... The true reasoning is to generate a unique use case, I want to eventually pump this
 ... content into Medium.com, where I will keep track of the incoming analytics.
 ... incoming analytics will tell us an independent use case, generated roboticly.
 ... The output will be SEO data to dive in, discover, and test again. The training
 ... for me will offer a place to write about automated poetry.
 ... My end goal is to generate a type of robot that can scrape over the entire poetry
 ... output and tell me the overall sentiment of the project explained above. The reason
 ... behind doing all of this work is to build a type of smart poetry bot.
 ... but without data, how smart can my bot be? I want to be able to generate a few things
 ... at the end of this project, a bot that says whether or not the poetry is good, (longterm)
 ... my long term vision would be to get the data together, per page, republish my findings.
 ... The data will serve to be a guide to not only digital marketing best practices
 ... but also a good usecase to explain the complexities of digital content, content
 ... to allow end users, like you and me, to vote whether or not the bot made GOOD or BAD
 ... poetry, and effectively I want to build a community where people can collab on poems.
 ... Beyond that I would like to plug musicblip into the smart poetry machine, and
 ... come up with ways to use the "good" sounding analog recordings, with "good" poems.
 ... not trying to automate music, just trying to lay down the ground work for it...
 ... if I can get people to actively say "yes" or "no" - we could generate a logisitic
 ... regression model around what is going to be considered good or bad, based on the
 ... overall structure, sentiment analysis, and other things of that nature.
 ... I want to automate "good sounding" poetry... not just any poetry.
 ... By the time the project is complete, I will need to learn more about data science
 ... I hear some algorithms can handle this complexitiy, but to build a model...
 ... I need to build the data. And what's cool is, this nice, tangible, beautiful little
 ... bit of SEO packaged into it, and the data that comes with it will tell us...
 ... if maybe, just maybe, sentiment analysis and sentiment scoring is a part of ranking.
 ... maybe...
