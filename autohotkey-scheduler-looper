Not the sexiest way to automate pushing posts but it's extremely effective.
You can download pulover macro creator, or just download AHK, it's a simple code base to help you automate tons of cool stuff
But for today, you just need to LOOP your wordpress push script or pg13, 10 times....
You can do 200, 500, whatever you want. You will get that subdomain banned because people will report you if you do it too much...
Or too fast...
Or too obviouis that you're "SPAMMING"...
But what is spam?
Take that into consideration...
I don't think poetry is spam. Ergo, I'm not spamming. I think digital artwork comes at the price of looking spammy...
This is where you can "SLEEP" this macro... And make this loop as much as you want... How ever long you want it to sleep...
Sleep, 1000 = 1 second. enjoy.
Run, FILE LOCATION of BAT FILE... and, the directory, is the last portion of the code.
Remove the comments to add a SLEEP... Add 1000... to do 1 second, like I just said, are you paying attention?
Cool, remove the comments too. I push 10 at a time, clean up the title, and don't spam it much beyond that because i dont want to spam
Rather, i want to make inspiring content... So looping this 1000000 times... Is a bit much, unless you sleep, a lot...
Test it this way, and check your website to see if there are any new blogs.

Loop, 10

    Run, C:\x\x.bat, C:\x\
